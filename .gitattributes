* text=auto eol=lf

# NOTE - 'end_of_line' settings should always match with the settings in
# '.editorconfig', keeping the IDE's and git's parsers in sync.
# The main caveat is that certain Windows-based file extensions *must* be crlf,
# which are '*.sln', '*.cmd', and '*.bat', aside from any Powershell files
# ('*.ps1...'), and everything else can be safely managed with lf EOL's.

# Windows specific files should retain windows line-endings - see above...
